# Acceptance test data

The usage formatter uses the examples from the [Cucumber Compatibility Kit](https://github.com/cucumber/compatibility-kit)
for acceptance testing. These examples consist of `.ndjson` files created by
the CCK's reference implementation.

* The `.ndjson` files are copied in by running `npm install`.
* The expected `.json` files are created by running a test that updates them.

We ensure the `.ndjson` files stay up to date by running `npm install` in CI
and verifying nothing changed.

Should there be changes, the Java tests can be used to update the
expected data.

```shell
cd java
UPDATE_EXPECTED_FILES=true mvn test
```
